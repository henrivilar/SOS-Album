                <p id="song-lyric">Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out</br>
                    Get some air now, let your edge out</br>
                    Too soon, I spoke, you be heavy in my mind</br>
                    Can you get the heck out?</br>
                    I need rest now, got me bummed out</br>
                    You so, you so, you, baby, baby, babe</br>
                    I've been on my empty mind shit</br>
                    I try to keep from losin' the rest of me</br>
                    I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby</br>
                    You don't care</br>
                    Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent</br>
                    Tryna make sense of loose change</br>
                    Got me at war in my mind</br>
                    Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me</br>
                    Choose to watch</br>
                    While the world break up and fall on me</br>
                    All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile</br>
                    Still wanna try, still believe in (good days)</br>
                    Good days, always (good days)</br>
                    Always inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)</br>
                    Good day living in my mind</br>
                    Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations</br>
                    I disappear, if you let me</br>
                    Feeling like (on your own)</br>
                    Feeling like Jericho</br>
                    Feeling like Job when he lost his shit</br>
                    Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I</br>
                    Ooh, paid a deal, way to kill the mood</br>
                    Know you like that shit, yeah, groovy baby, baby</br>
                    Heavy on my empty mind shit</br>
                    I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (losin' the rest of me)</br>
                    Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe</br>
                    You don't care</br>
                    Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent (it's urgent)</br>
                    Tryna make sense of loose change</br>
                    Got me at war in my mind (my mind)</br>
                    Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me</br>
                    Choose to watch</br>
                    While the world break up and fall on me</br>
                    All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile</br>
                    Still wanna try, still believe in (good days, good days on my mind)</br>
                    Good days (good days on my mind)</br>
                    Always sunny inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)</br>
                    Good day living in my mind</br>
                    Gotta get right, tryna free my mind before the end of the world</br>
                    I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text</br>
                    I choose not to respond</br>
                    I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened</br>
                    Half of us layin' waste to our youth, is in the present</br>
                    Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now</br>
                    Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind</br>
                    You've been making me feel like I'm</br>
                    Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind</p>
